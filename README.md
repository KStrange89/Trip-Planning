# sqlalchemy-challenge

To begin planning a vacation to Hawaii, I want to look at the weather.

I want to find the ideal time to go to Honolulu, as well as climate information to help me with packing.

I used SQLAlchemy, Pandas, and Matplotlib to complete my analysis. Once my analysis was complete, I designed a Flask API with information regarding the climate. This API returns a JSON.

Doing a comparison of temperatures in June and temperatures in December, I found there was no significant difference.
